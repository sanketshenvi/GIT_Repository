Define a function to check if a list of words(passed as parameter) is/are palindrome. Convert the following words into a list and write a script calling the above defined function and print about which word in list is palindrome. 
1. Accolite
2. Noon
3. Bumper
4. Corporate
5. Malayalam
6. Madam
7. Civic

If the word is palindrome, then map each letter of that word to the number of alphabetical order and print the number corresponding to the word. For eg: If the word is 'AZF' the the corresponding number should be [(1+26+6) = 33] with A corresponding to 1 and Z to 26. 

After defining the number write two more functions to check if a number is odd/even and if it is an armstrong number and call these 2 functions to check the number obtained from palindrome words.
